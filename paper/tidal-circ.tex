% Context
Short-period binary star systems dissipate orbital energy through tidal
interactions that lead to tighter, more circular orbits.
When at least one star in a binary has evolved off of the main sequence, orbital
circularization occurs for longer-period ($\approx 100~\textrm{day}$) systems.
Past work by \citet{Verbunt:1995} has shown that the orbital parameters and the
\changes{transition} periods of a small sample of binary stars with evolved-star
members can be understood within the context of standard tidal circularization
theory.
% Aims
Using a sample of binaries with subgiant, giant, and red clump star members that
is nearly an order of magnitude larger, we reexamine predictions for tidal
circularization of binary stars with evolved members.
% Methods
% Results
\changes{We confirm that binary-star systems in our sample predicted to have
circular orbits (using equilibrium-tide theory) generally have negligible
measured eccentricities.}
\changes{At fixed stellar mass,} the \changes{transition} period is correlated
with the surface gravity (i.e. size) of the evolved member, indicating that the
circularization timescale must be shorter than the evolutionary timescale along
the giant branch.
A few exceptions to the conclusions above are mentioned in the discussion: Some
of these exceptions are likely systems in which the spectrum of the secondary
biases the radial velocity measurements, but four appear to be genuine,
short-period, moderate-eccentricity systems.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

From studies of binary star systems in open clusters, it is clear that
short-period binaries tend to have smaller eccentricities as compared to
longer-period binaries of the same age (e.g., \citealt{Mathieu:2005}).
Within a given population of binaries, this manifests as an apparently steep transition from a spread in eccentricities to mainly circularized orbits that occurs around a characteristic value of the orbital period.
The value of this ``transition period'' or ``circularization period'' depends on the age and evolutionary state of the population (see, e.g., \figurename~5 in \citealt{Mathieu:2005}).
Many studies have measured this transition period, predominantly for main-sequence binaries (e.g., \citealt{Latham:2002, Meibom:2006, Kjurkchieva:2017}), and have found that it tends to be between 5--20 days, depending on age (e.g., \citealt{Mathieu:1988}).
For binary star systems with giant star members, the transition period is longer, closer to $\approx 100$ days (e.g., \citealt{Mayor:1984, Bluhm:2016}), but fewer such systems have been studied.
These observed trends are likely a result of binary orbital circularization rather than a manifestation of binary star formation, as the transition period appears to vary with the age of the stellar population (\citealt{Meibom:2005}).

Theoretical predictions for orbital circularization generally explain this phenomenon by assuming that orbital energy is tidally dissipated within each binary star member, with an efficiency and timescale set by the stellar structure of the members (see \citealt{Mazeh:2007hp, Zahn:2008} for recent reviews).
For stars with deep convective zones (and especially evolved stars), the equilibrium tide theory of orbital circularization (\citealt{Zahn:1977, Zahn:1989}) has been shown to predict the eccentricity evolution and therefore transition periods of a small sample of binaries with giant star members in open clusters of different ages (\citealt{Verbunt:1995}, hereafter VP95).
In this theory, the tidal bulge induced on the primary (evolved) star will lag
the orbital motion of the companion because of coupling of the tidal flow to
turbulent eddies driven by convection.
These eddies cause an effective viscosity in the convective region of the
primary star, and the magnitude of this viscosity affects the amount of lag,
which directly relates to the circularization timescale for a given binary
system (\citealt{Zahn:1989}).
This viscous dissipation of orbital energy acts to synchronize and circularize a
binary system, and align the rotational and orbital axes (\citealt{Zahn:1977,
Zahn:1989}).

In the context of equilibrium tide theory (e.g., \citealt{Zahn:1989}), the
time-dependence of the eccentricity, $e$, and semi-major axis, $a$, of a binary
star system is given by
\begin{align}
    \frac{1}{t_\textrm{circ}} &= f \,
        \left(\frac{L_1}{M_{\textrm{env}} \, R_1^2}\right)^{1/3} \,
        \frac{M_{\textrm{env}}}{M_1} \,
        q \, (1 + q) \,
        \left(\frac{R_1}{a}\right)^8 \label{eq:tcirc}\\
    \frac{1}{e} \, \frac{\dd e}{\dd t} &= - \frac{1}{t_\textrm{circ}}
        \label{eq:dlne} \\
    \frac{1}{a} \, \frac{\dd a}{\dd t} &= - \frac{38}{7} \, e^2 \,
        \frac{1}{t_\textrm{circ}} \label{eq:dlna}
\end{align}
where $L_1, M_1, R_1$ are the luminosity, mass, and radius of the primary
(evolved) star, $M_{\textrm{env}}$ is the mass of the convective envelope of the
primary, $q = M_2 / M_1$ is the binary mass ratio, $a$ is the binary semi-major
axis, $f$ is a dimensionless factor of order unity that depends on the
convective and dissipative properties of the convective envelope, and $t_{\textrm{circ}}$ is the characteristic circularization timescale (\citealt{Zahn:1977, Zahn:1989, Verbunt:1995}).
These expressions can be used to solve for the predicted change in eccentricity of a given binary system whose primary stellar parameters (i.e. mass, radius, etc.) and binary mass ratio are known.
Loosely following the notation of VP95 for a binary star system of age $\tau$, and by neglecting the semi-major axis evolution, the change in eccentricity is given by the integral
\begin{align}
    \Delta \ln e &= \int^\tau_0 \, \dd t \, t_{\textrm{circ}}^{-1}\\
    &= A \, \int^\tau_0 \, \dd t \, \left(\frac{L_1}{R_1^2}\right)^{1/3} \,
        M_{\rm env}^{2/3} \, R_1^8
\end{align}
over the lifetime of the primary star, where we have collected all terms that are time-independent into the constant
\begin{align}
    A &= f \, \frac{q \, (1+q)}{M_1 \, a^8}\\
    &= \frac{(2\pi)^{16/3}}{(G \, M_1)^{8/3}} \,
        \frac{q}{(1+q)^{5/3} \, M_1} \,
        \frac{1}{P^{16/3}}
\end{align}
($P$ is the binary orbital period).
Within the context of this theory and following VP95, the predicted transition period of a stellar population can then be estimated by solving for the orbital period, $P$, of a binary system of typical mass and mass ratio for that population at which $\Delta \ln e = -3$ (i.e. the final eccentricity is 1/20 of the initial eccentricity, as described in VP95).

The steep $\left(R_1 / a\right)^8$ scaling in \eqname~\ref{eq:tcirc}
implies that, for a given binary, even small changes in the radius of the
primary results in very large changes to the circularization timescale.
For example, for binary stars with periods $P \gtrsim 10~\textrm{day}$, we
expect orbital circularization to occur rapidly when the primary begins to
evolve.
Further, if the circularization timescale (\eqname~\ref{eq:tcirc}) remains short
compared to the evolutionary timescale along the subgiant and giant branches,
then the transition period of a sample of binary stars should
correlate with the present-day radius or evolutionary state of each primary.

Using a sample of $>200$ binary star systems with at least one evolved member --- nearly a factor of 10 larger than previous work --- we study the transition period along the giant branch.
We show that the inferred transition period is a function of the surface gravity of the primary star, and therefore conclude that, for binary star systems with large convective regions, orbital circularization must occur faster than the timescale of stellar radius and structure evolution of post-main-sequence stars.

In \sectionname~\ref{sec:data}, we describe the original data source and catalog of binary star systems used in this work.
In \sectionname~\ref{sec:results}, we present period-eccentricity distributions as a function of primary star properties and compare with predictions from equilibrium tide theory.
In \sectionname~\ref{sec:theory}, we produce simulated populations of binary systems using equilibrium tide theory that qualitatively match the observed distributions.
In \sectionname~\ref{sec:discussion}, we discuss assumptions and caveats with this work, and highlight a few interesting systems that would benefit from follow-up observations.
We conclude in \sectionname~\ref{sec:conclusions}.

\end{figure}

To identify binaries, we use sources with repeat radial velocity measurements in
data release 14 (\DR) of the \apogee\ survey
(\citealt{Majewski:2017,Abolfathi:2017}), a component of the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey IV (\sdssiv; \citealt{Gunn:2006,Blanton:2017}).
\changes{\apogee\ is a medium-resolution ($R \sim XX$), mid-infrared ($H$-band) spectroscopic survey that uses the SDSS telescope in the northern hemisphere to survey (primarily) red stars throughout the Galaxy.
The primary objective of the survey is to determine kinematics and chemical abundances for a large sample of Milky Way stars to study the evolution and dynamical state of the Galaxy \citealt{Majewski:2017}.
For the key components of the survey, targets are selected using simple color and magnitude cuts designed to primarily target bright, distant (i.e. giant) stars (\citealt{Zasowski:2013}).
However, to meet signal-to-noise requirements for faint targets, many fields are observed multiple times and therefore provide limited time-domain radial velocity measurements (e.g., \citealt{Nidever:2015}).
We have used the time-domain radial velocity measurements from \apogee\ \DR\ to search for and characterize binary star systems;
A full description of our search methodology and binary star catalogs can be
found in companion work (\citealt{Price-Whelan:2018}).
}

Briefly, we use a custom-built Monte Carlo sampler (\package{The Joker};
\citealt{Price-Whelan:2017}) to generate posterior samples over binary orbital
parameters (period, eccentricity, etc.) for all stars with $\geq 3$ radial
velocity measurements in \apogee\ \DR\ that pass a series of quality cuts.
By making cuts on our posterior belief about the amplitude of radial velocity
variations, we identified $\sim$5,000 binary star systems with at least one
evolved member \changes{that dominates the luminosity of each system}.
However, the majority of these systems have too few radial velocity measurements
to uniquely determine the binary orbital parameters.

Here, we consider only \nunimodal\ binary systems for which the period and
eccentricity can be uniquely determined \changes{from the radial velocity data
alone} (the ``high-$K$, unimodal'' sample of \citealt{Price-Whelan:2018}).
We further subselect the \nclean\ primary stars with $\logg > 2$ that pass
visual inspection (from previous work, \texttt{clean\_flag == 0}; see
\sectionname~5.2 in \citealt{Price-Whelan:2018}).
We note that because of the sparse time sampling of the \apogee\ survey, we
expect that our detection efficiency for high-eccentricity systems is poor, but
do not expect biases for low-eccentricity systems.
\figurename~\ref{fig:apogee}, left panel, shows the stellar parameters (surface
gravity, $\log g$, and effective temperatue, $T_{\textrm{eff}}$) for all
\nclean\ primary stars in the sample used in this work, middle panel shows the
distribution of primary masses for the 68 systems with masses from
\cite{Ness:2016}, and right panel shows the minimum mass ratios for the 68

\section{Orbital circularization of \apogee\ binaries}
\label{sec:results}

Our sample of binaries contains primary stars with a range of stellar parameters
(\figurename~\ref{fig:apogee}), and therefore a range of expected
\changes{transition} periods.
\figurename~\ref{fig:P-e-grid} shows orbital period and eccentricity for all
systems in bins of primary surface gravity:
From top left to bottom right shows bins of decreasing surface gravity, i.e.
from subgiants to giant branch stars.
Vertical dashed lines at $10~\textrm{day}$ and $100~\textrm{day}$ are meant as
reference lines.
Note the steadily increasing \changes{transition} period from top left to bottom
right as the typical size of the primary increases.

To remove the dependence on the size of the primary, \figurename~\ref{fig:PeK}
(left) shows period and eccentricity but now with periods normalized by the
orbital period at which the minimum separation of \changes{the centers of mass
of the binary star components} is equal to the surface size of the primary star,
\begin{align}
    \Psurf &= 2\pi \,
        \left(\frac{G \, (M_1+M_2)}{R_1^3}\right)^{-1/2} \,
        \left(1-e\right)^{-3/2}
    \quad . \label{eq:Psurf}
\end{align}
We compute \Psurf\ for all systems under the following assumptions:
\begin{description}
    \item[Primary/companion masses] Only a small fraction of the systems in our
    sample have measured primary masses (\figurename~\ref{fig:apogee}) and
    therefore have measured (minimum) mass ratios.
    We make the simplifying assumption that all primary stars have masses equal
    to the median mass over all stars with prior mass measurements in this
    sample, $\med{M_1} = 1.36~\msun$, and all companions have masses equal to
    the median over minimum companion masses, $\med{M_{2, \textrm{min}}} =
    0.5~\msun$.
    \item[Primary evolved first] We assume that the primary star (i.e. the
    observed star) is the first member of the binary to evolve off the main
    sequence.
    \item[First ascent] We assume that all primary stars are on their first
    ascent up the giant branch.
    This is motivated by the small fraction of red clump stars in our sample:
    Only 7 of the primaries were identified as confident red clump stars in a
    recent study of \apogee\ \DR\ evolved star (\citealt{Ting:2018}).

\end{figure}

Assuming that the semi-major axes of the \apogee\ binaries have remained
constant, and with the assumptions above, we can also compute the expected
change in eccentricity, $\Delta \ln e$, for each binary (see also \figurename~4
in \citealt{Verbunt:1995}).
As noted in \citet{Verbunt:1995}, the assumption of constant binary semi-major
axis is technically incorrect, but the typical change to the semi-major axis is
only between 1--10\%, i.e. smaller than the uncertainty introduced in the
inferred semi-major axes for our systems due to unknown inclination.

To compute $\Delta \ln e$, we use a model stellar evolution track to integrate
\eqname~\ref{eq:dlne} up to the measured \logg\ of each primary star.
In detail, we use \acronym{MESA} (\citealt{Paxton:2011}) to follow the stellar evolution of a $M_1 = 1.4~\msun$ star with solar metallicity from the pre-main-sequence (PMS) phase to the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase (we stop the models when they first reach $\logg = 0$).
\changes{The output evolutionary track contains the luminosity, $L_1$, radius, $R_1$, and convective envelope mass, $M_{\rm env}$, at each of $\sim 10^4$ time steps between the PMS and AGB phase.}
For each \apogee\ star, we then use linear interpolation with the output of this
evolutionary model to solve for the eccentricity change starting from the time
the star leaves the main sequence up to the phase at which the model has the
same surface gravity as is measured.
We use 10,000 steps evenly spaced between these two phases and use Simpson's
rule to compute the integral.

\figurename~\ref{fig:dlne} shows the expected change in eccentricity plotted
against the observed eccentricity for all of the \apogee\ binaries.
With the exception of a few outliers, systems that are predicted to have large
negative changes to the log-eccentricity are circular.
This confirms the conclusions of previous work based on a much smaller sample of
giant star binaries (\citealt{Verbunt:1995}): the theory of equilibrium tides
successfully explains the observed eccentricities of close binaries with
member stars that have large convective envelopes.

\section{Population synthesis}
\label{sec:theory}

% \todo{Equivalent of Figure 1 for the simulated population}

To compare with the data, we generate a simulated population of binary star
systems with primary stars that have similar stellar parameters (by the end of
their evolution) to our sample of \apogee\ system primaries.
We assume simple initial binary orbital parameter distributions (i.e. in period
and eccentricity) and compute the change in eccentricity and separation of the
companion orbit as the primary star evolves off the main sequence.

In detail, we sample primary stellar masses, companion masses, and primary
surface gravities by fitting two-component Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) to the
stars in our sample with measurements of each, then re-sample using the fitted
distributions.
As described in previous work (\citealt{Price-Whelan:2018}), primary mass
measurements come from \cite{Ness:2016}, secondary (minimum) masses come from
the posterior samplings over orbital parameters using \apogee\ radial velocity
data, and surface gravities come from the \apogee\ (\DR) data reduction pipeline
(\citealt{Garcia-Perez:2016}).
In our sample, the median primary mass, companion mass, and surface gravity are
$\med{M_1} = 1.4~\msun$, $\med{M_{2, \textrm{min}}} = 0.4~\msun$, and
$\med{\logg} = 3.1$.
We assume $M_2 = M_{2, \textrm{min}}$ when generating companion masses.

We generate eccentricities $e$ by sampling from a truncated normal distribution
with mean and standard deviation $(\mu, \sigma) = (0.4, 0.3)$, truncated to the
domain $[0, 1]$.
We note that theoretical predictions of the binary star eccentricity distribution over this period range \changes{(1--1000 days)} would predict a thermalized eccentricity distribution $p(e) = 2e$ (\citealt{Jeans:1919}), but the observed eccentricity distributions of main sequence binary star systems with periods $10 < P < 1000~\textrm{day}$ is broadly consistent with being flat for moderate eccentricities, with fewer very low and high eccentricities (\citealt{Duchene:2013}).
Our comparison with this simulated population does not depend strongly on this
choice of initial eccentricity distribution.

We generate initial binary orbital periods, $P$, by assuming a distribution that
is uniform in $\ln P$ between $(\Psurf, 8192)~\textrm{day}$.
\figurename~\ref{fig:simulated} (left) shows the initial periods and
eccentricities of the simulated systems.
Markers are colored by the mass of the primary, $M_1$, and the size of the
marker indicates the log-surface gravity, \logg.

To follow the stellar evolution of the primary stars, we run stellar evolution
models using \acronym{MESA} (\citealt{Paxton:2011}) for stars with $M = [0.8, 1,
1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2, 2.5, 3]~\msun$ and solar metallicity.
\figurename~\ref{fig:mesa} shows evolutionary tracks in surface gravity and
effective temperature for each of these models.
We follow the evolution from the pre-main-sequence phase until the AGB phase,
but again only use the post-main-sequence evolution when evolving the orbit of
the binary.
At each timestep during the evolution, we output and store all stellar parameters (primarily $R_1$ and $L_1$) along with the size and mass of the convective envelope, $M_{\rm env}$.

\end{figure}

We discretize the primary masses generated from the GMMs onto the grid of masses
for which we have \acronym{MESA} models, then use equilibrium tide theory to
compute the change in eccentricity and separation of the companion orbit.
To do this, we solve the coupled differential equations \eqname
s~\ref{eq:dlne}--\ref{eq:dlna} up to the phase of evolution at which the stellar
model has the same (or closest) surface gravity to the simulated primary star.
We use the first-order Euler method with 10,000 time steps between the main
sequence and the given final \logg\ of each primary star, and use linear
interpolation to interpolate the \acronym{MESA} output stellar parameters onto
the integration grid.
We assume that all stars are on their first ascent up the giant branch, which
should underestimate the number of circularized systems with surface gravities
$\logg \sim 2.5$ (i.e. near the red clump, where stars have already reached the
tip of the giant branch).
We assume that the equilibrium tides dominate the circularization process for
all systems and therefore ignore the effect of ``dynamical tides''
(e.g., \citealt{Goodman:1998}) during the main sequence phase.
Finally, we assume that all of our systems are detached binaries.

\figurename~\ref{fig:simulated} (middle) shows the final periods and
eccentricities of the simulated systems.
As expected, the \changes{transition} period for higher \logg\ systems (i.e.
smaller radii, lighter markers) appears to be close to $\sim 10~\textrm{day}$,
but the \changes{transition} period for stars with lower \logg\ (i.e. larger
radii, darker markers) is closer to $\sim 100~\textrm{day}$.
In the right panel we normalize the orbital period by \Psurf:
This rescaling removes the dependence on primary size or \logg\ and predicts
that circularization should occur around $P / \Psurf \approx 10$.
The simulated systems that remain very eccentric, $e \gtrsim 0.6$, with periods
$P / \Psurf < 10$ are likely a relic of the fact that \eqname
s~\ref{eq:dlne}--\ref{eq:dlna} break down when $e \sim 1$ (e.g.,
\citealt{Hut:1981}).

The sharp transition in eccentricity around $P/\Psurf \approx 10$ or $a/R_1

\section{Discussion} \label{sec:discussion}

\subsection{Assumptions}

Here we return to the assumptions made above and assess their applicability:
\begin{description}
    \item[Primary/companion masses] Most of the systems in our sample of
    binaries have unmeasured primary or companion masses.
    In computing the normalization period, \Psurf, and to estimate the predicted
    change in eccentricity, $\Delta \ln e$, we have thus made simple assumptions
    about the binary component masses (see \emph{Primary/companion masses}
    above).
    It is therefore interesting that we see such a sharp transition in the
    eccentricity distribution (\figurename~\ref{fig:PeK}, left panel), and good
    agreement with predictions from population synthesis and evolution of the
    simulated binaries (\sectionname~\ref{sec:theory}).
    However, this can be understood given the scaling of the circularization
    timescale (\eqname~\ref{eq:tcirc}) and the mass distribution of stars with
    measured masses (\figurename~\ref{fig:apogee})

    Assuming a mass ratio $q = 0.3$, the circularization timescale close to the
    \changes{transition} period, $P / \Psurf \approx 10$, is very small compared
    to the lifetime on the giant branch for a $1.4~\msun$ star, $t_\textrm{circ}
    \sim 10^5~\textrm{yr} \ll t_\textrm{RGB} \sim 10^8~\textrm{yr}$.
    The circularization time scales with the inverse mass ratio squared and the
    cubed-root of the primary mass, $t_\textrm{circ} \propto M_1^{1/3} \, \left[
    q \, (1 + q) \right]^{-1}$:
    The small spread in primary masses can therefore be neglected, and
    variations in the mass ratio by typical factors of $\sim 2$
    (\figurename~\ref{fig:apogee}) still lead to circularization timescales that
    are much shorter than the giant branch lifetime.
    For the sample of binaries considered here, the simple assumptions about
    primary and companion masses are therefore reasonable.
    \item[Primary evolved first] All of the binaries in our sample appear to be
    single-lined (from visual inspection of the \apogee\ spectra).
    Therefore, if the companion evolved first, it would now be a stellar
    remnant, and its evolution as a giant would have contributed significantly
    to the orbital circularization.
    Only 4 of the systems with measured masses have minimum mass ratios above 1,
    indicating a possible neutron star or black hole companion.
    However, an unknown fraction could have white dwarf companions.
    Still, the majority of systems in the subset with measured masses are
    consistent with low-mass main sequence companions.
    \item[First ascent] As mentioned above, only 7 of the primary stars in our
    sample are likely red clump stars (\citealt{Ting:2018}), and these systems
    all have periods between $120$--$1000~\textrm{day}$.
    This is possibly because shorter period companions would have been
    common-envelope when the evolved star reached the tip of the red giant
    branch: During this phase, rapid orbit evolution with timescales of months
    to years will cause engulfment and possible destruction of the companion
    (e.g., \citealt{Nordhaus:2010}).
    We therefore consider this to be a reasonable assumption.
\end{description}

\subsection{Applicability of tidal theory}

% "If the duration of the tidal perturbation at periastron passage is shorter than the convective turnover time, the efficiency of tidal coupling may be significantly reduced" - http://cds.cern.ch/record/976941/files/0608154.pdf

\changes{
The expressions derived from equilibrium tide theory (i.e. \eqname~\ref{eq:tcirc}--\ref{eq:dlna}) and used to predict the circularization of binary systems in this work are linearized in eccentricity, $e$, and are therefore only strictly correct for small initial eccentricities (e.g., \citealt{Zahn:1989, Mazeh:2007}).
For systems with large initial eccentricity, circularization is expected to be less efficient because the tidal interaction timescale is dominated by the short period of interaction during pericenter, which can be shorter than the convective turnover timescale (e.g., \citealt{Goldman:1991, Goldman:1994, Goodman:1997}).
However, these expressions have been shown to explain the observed binary period-eccentricity distributions in several stellar clusters over a range of ages ($<10~\textrm{Myr}$--$10~\textrm{Gyr}$; \citealt{Meibom:2005}), even for systems with high eccentricities ($e \lesssim 0.8$).
In addition, conclusions from equilibrium tide theory seem to successfully predict the upper envelope of the eccentricity distribution as a function of period even for very high-eccentricity ``heartbeat'' star systems (\citealt{Shporer:2016}).
Since the bulk of our sample consists of systems with $e < 0.5$, it is therefore likely safe to use this theory to compare predictions with the observed properties of our sample.
% However, a few outlier systems appear in figures throughout this work (e.g., short period, high eccentricity systems in \figurename~\ref{fig:dlne}), that may indicate systems that began with high eccentricity where
}

\subsection{Exceptional systems}

There are 10 systems with $e > 0.1$ and $P/\Psurf < 6$ apparent in \figurename
s~\ref{fig:PeK} and \ref{fig:dlne}.
These binaries have short periods and large eccentricities that appear to be
discrepant with our conclusions made about tidal circularization.
Of these 10 systems, 6 have the warning flag \texttt{SUSPECT\_BROAD\_LINES} from
the \apogee\ pipeline, which suggests that these primary stars are either fast
rotators or may contain blended light from the companion star; The inferred
eccentricities for these systems may therefore be biased.
In total, 39 systems distributed over the full range of periods have this
warning flag.
The remaining 4 systems are listed in \tablename~\ref{tbl:except} and warrant
further study to understand why they have not circularized.
One possibility is that these are actually triple systems with misaligned,
long-period companions: The outer body could drive the eccentricity of the inner
companion through Kozai-Lidov oscillations (\citealt{Kozai:1962, Lidov:1962}).
Verifying this would require long-term radial velocity monitoring of these
systems.

\end{table}

Another interesting set of systems have negligible measured eccentricities with
periods between $10 < P < 100~\textrm{day}$ (see top middle and right panels of
\figurename~\ref{fig:P-e-grid}).
Analogs of these systems are also seen in the simulated population in the middle
panel of \figurename~\ref{fig:simulated}: In the simulated population, these are
simply systems that started with lower eccentricities and thus can evolve faster
to $e \approx 0$.
In the observed systems, we expect the ``spur'' of low-eccentricity systems at
periods longer than the \changes{transition} period to be a mix of systems that
started with lower eccentricity, systems in which the companion has already
evolved, and a minority of red clump stars that circularized when the primary
was at the tip of the giant branch.


\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We selected binary star systems with well-determined orbital properties from a
catalog of binaries identified using repeat radial velocity measurements from
the \apogee\ survey (\citealt{Price-Whelan:2018}).
Because of the selection function for \apogee, the majority of these systems
contain an evolved primary star that dominates the luminosity of the system, and
thus these systems are predominantly single-lined spectroscopic binaries.
The systems have a range of orbital periods and the primaries have a range of
surface gravities, indicating that they are a mix of subgiant, giant branch, and
red clump stars (\figurename~\ref{fig:apogee}).

As has been seen in many other samples of binary star systems, we find that the
short period systems have small or zero eccentricities, but above a
characteristic \changes{transition} period the systems have a range of
eccentricities; This \changes{transition} period depends on the stellar
parameters of the primary (evolved) star in the system
(\figurename~\ref{fig:P-e-grid}).
If we normalize the orbital periods by the orbital period of the system with a
hypothetical companion whose orbit just grazes the surface of the primary star
(i.e. to remove the dependence on the primary star size), we find a steep
transition from eccentric to circular orbits that occurs around $P / \Psurf
\approx 10$.
This dimensionless \changes{transition} period is consistent with theoretical
predictions (\figurename~\ref{fig:simulated}):
We find that the eccentricities and observed \changes{transition} periods of
binary star systems with evolved members can be explained using standard tidal
circularization theory for stars with significant convective envelopes
(\citealt{Zahn:1977, Zahn:1989, Verbunt:1995}).

The \apogee\ survey was not designed to do binary star science
(\citealt{Majewski:2017}), but has enabled a number of stellar companion studies
because it returns to fields as a part of its survey strategy
(\citealt{Troup:2016, Badenes:2018, Price-Whelan:2018}).
Future data releases from \apogee\ will provide more visits for current stars
and nearly twice as many sources, which will allow more detailed studies of
tidal circularization and other binary star phenomena.
However, for bright stars, the end-of-mission data release of the \project{Gaia}
mission will revolutionize binary star science by providing time-series radial
velocity information for nearly 100 million stars.
