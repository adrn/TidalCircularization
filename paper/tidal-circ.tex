% Context
Short-period binary star systems dissipate orbital energy through tidal
interactions that lead to tighter, more circular orbits.
When at least one star in a binary has evolved off of the main sequence, orbital
circularization occurs for longer-period ($\approx 100~\textrm{day}$) systems.
It has been shown that the orbital parameters and the circularization periods of
a small sample of binary stars with evolved star members can be understood
within the context of standard tidal circularization theory.
% Aims
Using a sample of binaries with subgiant, giant, and red clump star members that
is nearly an order of magnitude larger in size relative to previous work, we
reexamine predictions for tidal circularization of binary stars with evolved
star members.
% Methods
% Results
We confirm that equilibrium tide theory qualitatively ...
We additionally show that the circularization period is correlated with the
surface gravity (i.e. size) of the evolved star member, indicating that the
circularization timescale must be shorter than the evolutionary timescale along
the giant branch.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

From studies of binary star systems in open clusters, it is clear that
short-period binaries tend to have smaller eccentricities as compared to
longer-period binaries of the same age (e.g., \citealt{Mathieu:2005}).
Within a given population of binaries, this manifests as an apparently steep
transition from a spread in eccentricities to mainly circularized orbits
that occurs around some characteristic period (see, e.g., \figurename~5 in
\citealt{Mathieu:2005}) that depends on the age and evolutionary state of the
population.
Many studies have measured the ``circularization period,'' predominantly for
main-sequence binaries (e.g., \citealt{Latham:2002, Meibom:2006,
Kjurkchieva:2017}), and have found that it tends to be between 5--20 days,
depending on age (e.g., \citealt{Mathieu:1988}).
For giant stars, the circularization period appears to be longer, closer to
$\approx 100$ days (e.g., \citealt{Mayor:1984, Bluhm:2016}), but fewer systems
with giant star members have been studied.
These observed trends are likely a result of orbital circularization rather than
a manifestation of binary star formation, as the circularization or transition
period appears to vary with the age of the population (\citealt{Meibom:2005}).

Theories that explain orbital circularization generally rely on tidal
dissipation to explain and predict the timescales of this phenomenon (see
\citealt{Mazeh:2007hp} for a review).
For stars with deep convective zones (and especially evolved stars), the
equilibrium tide theory for circularization (\citealt{Zahn:1977, Zahn:1989}) has
been shown to reasonably reproduce the circularization periods of a small sample
of binaries with giant star members in open clusters (\citealt{Verbunt:1995}).
In this theory, the tidal bulge induced on the primary (evolved) star will lag
the orbital motion of the companion because of coupling of the tidal flow to
turbulent eddies driven by convection.
These eddies cause an effective viscosity in the convective region of the
primary star, and the magnitude of this viscosity affects the amount of lag,
which directly relates to the circularization timescale for a given binary
system (\citealt{Zahn:1989}; also summarized in \citealt{Goodman:1997}).
This viscous dissipation of orbital energy acts to synchronize and circularize a
binary system (\citealt{Zahn:1977, Zahn:1989}).

In the context of equilibrium tide theory, the time-dependence of the
eccentricity, $e$, and semi-major axis, $a$, of a binary star system is given by
\begin{align}
    \frac{1}{t_\textrm{circ}} &= f \,
        \left(\frac{L_1}{M_{\textrm{env}} \, R_1^2}\right)^{1/3} \,
        \frac{M_{\textrm{env}}}{M_1} \,
        q \, (1 + q) \,
        \left(\frac{R_1}{a}\right)^8 \label{eq:tcirc}\\
    \frac{1}{e} \, \frac{\dd e}{\dd t} &= - \frac{1}{t_\textrm{circ}}
        \label{eq:dlne} \\
    \frac{1}{a} \, \frac{\dd a}{\dd t} &= - \frac{38}{7} \, e^2 \,
        \frac{1}{t_\textrm{circ}} \label{eq:dlna}
\end{align}
where $L_1, M_1, R_1$ are the luminosity, mass, and radius of the primary
(evolved) star, $M_{\textrm{env}}$ is the mass of the convective envelope of the
primary, $q = M_2 / M_1$ is the binary mass ratio, $a$ is the binary semi-major
axis, and $f$ is a dimensionless factor of order unity that depends on the
convective and dissipative properties of the convective envelope
(\citealt{Zahn:1977,Zahn:1989,Verbunt:1995}).

The steep $\left(R_1 / a\right)^8$ scaling in \eqname~\ref{eq:tcirc}
implies that, for a given binary, even small changes in the radius of the
primary results in very large changes to the circularization timescale.
For example, for binary stars with periods $P \gtrsim 10~\textrm{day}$, we
expect orbital circularization to occur rapidly only as the primary begins to
evolve.
Further, if the circularization timescale (\eqname~\ref{eq:tcirc}) remains short
compared to the evolutionary timescale along the subgiant and giant branches,
then the circularization period of a sample of binary stars should correlate
with the radius or evolutionary state of the primary.

Using a significantly larger sample of binary star systems with at least one
evolved member, we study the circularization period along the giant branch.
We show that indeed the inferred circularization period is a function of the
surface gravity of the primary star, and thus that orbital circularization must
occur faster than post-main-sequence stellar radius and structure evolution.

In \sectionname~\ref{sec:data}, we describe the original data source and catalog
of binary star systems used in this work.
In \sectionname~\ref{sec:results}, we show how the circularization period changes in bins of primary-star surface gravity.
In \sectionname~\ref{sec:discussion}, we discuss \todo{...}

% Past work on samples of binary systems with giant star members showed
% that, while main sequence binaries have circularization periods near $\sim
% 10~\textrm{day}$, the circularization period for the giant star binaries is
% typically $\sim 100~\textrm{day}$ (\citealt{Mayor:1984}).
% For a subset of 28 giant star binaries in open clusters (and therefore have age
% estimates), VP95 also show that the systems predicted to be circular (those
% predicted to have large $\Delta \ln e$) do indeed have small measured
% eccentricities.

\section{Data} \label{sec:data}

To identify binaries, we use sources with repeat radial velocity measurements in
data release 14 (\DR) of the \apogee\ survey
(\citealt{Majewski:2017,Abolfathi:2017}), a component of the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey IV (\sdssiv; \citealt{Gunn:2006,Blanton:2017}).
A full description of our search methodology and binary star catalogs can be
found in companion work (\citealt{Price-Whelan:2018}).

Briefly, we use a custom-built Monte Carlo sampler (\package{The Joker};
\citealt{Price-Whelan:2017}) to generate posterior samples over binary orbital
parameters (period, eccentricity, etc.) for all stars with $\geq 3$ radial
velocity measurements in \apogee\ \DR\ that pass a series of quality cuts.
By making cuts on our posterior belief about the amplitude of radial velocity
variations, we identified $\sim$5,000 binary star systems with at least one
evolved star member.
However, the majority of these systems have too few radial velocity measurements
to uniquely determine the binary orbital parameters.

Here, we only consider \nunimodal\ binary systems for which the period and
eccentricity can be uniquely determined (the ``high-$K$, unimodal'' sample of
\citealt{Price-Whelan:2018}).
We further subselect the \nclean\ primary stars with $\logg > 2$ and that pass
visual inspection (from previous work, \texttt{clean\_flag == 0}; see
\sectionname~5.2 in \citealt{Price-Whelan:2018}).
\figurename~\ref{fig:logg-teff-m1} (left) shows the stellar parameters for all
\nclean\ primary stars in the sample used in this work.
\figurename~\ref{fig:logg-teff-m1} (right) shows the distribution of primary
masses for the 68 systems with masses from \cite{Ness:2015}.

\section{Population synthesis}
\label{sec:theory}

To compare with the data, we generate a simulated population of binary star
systems with primary stars that have similar stellar parameters (by the end of
their evolution) to our sample of \apogee\ system primaries.
We assume simple initial binary orbital parameter distributions (i.e. in period
and eccentricity) and compute the change in eccentricity and separation of the
companion orbit as the primary star evolves off the main sequence.

In detail, we sample primary stellar masses, companion masses, and primary
surface gravities by fitting two-component Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) to the
stars in our sample with measurements of each, then re-sample using the fitted
distributions.
As described in previous work (\citealt{Price-Whelan:2018}), primary mass
measurements come from \cite{Ness:2015}, secondary (minimum) masses come from
the posterior samplings over orbital parameters using \apogee\ radial velocity
data, and surface gravities come from the \apogee\ (\DR) data reduction pipeline
(\citealt{Garcia-Perez:2016}).
In our sample, the median primary mass, companion mass, and surface gravity are
$\med{M_1} = 1.4~\msun$, $\med{M_{2, \textrm{min}}} = 0.4~\msun$, and
$\med{\logg} = 3.1$.
We assume $M_2 = M_{2, \textrm{min}}$ when generating companion masses.

We generate eccentricities $e$ by sampling from a beta distribution with
parameters $(a, b) = (1, 2)$, meant to mimic the distribution of eccentricities
for long-period binary systems in our sample.
We generate initial binary orbital periods, $P$, by assuming a distribution that
is uniform in $\ln P$ between $(\Psurf, 8192)~\textrm{day}$, where
\Psurf\ is the orbital period at which the minimum separation is
equal to the surface size of the primary star,
\begin{align}
    \Psurf &= 2\pi \,
        \left(\frac{G \, (M_1+M_2)}{R_1^3}\right)^{-1/2} \,
        \left(1-e\right)^{-3/2}
    \quad . \label{eq:Psurf}
\end{align}
\figurename~\ref{fig:simulated} (left) shows the initial periods and
eccentricities of the simulated systems.
Markers are colored by the mass of the primary, $M_1$, and the size of the
marker indicates the log-surface gravity, \logg.

To follow the stellar evolution of the primary, we run stellar evolution models
using \acronym{MESA} (\citealt{Paxton:2011}) for stars with $M = [0.8, 1, 1.2,
1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2, 2.5, 3]~\msun$ and solar metallicity.
\figurename~\ref{fig:mesa} shows evolutionary tracks in surface gravity and
effective temperature for each of these models.
We follow the evolution from the pre-main-sequence phase until the AGB phase,
but only use the post-main-sequence evolution when evolving the orbit of the
binary.
At each timestep during the evolution, we output and store the standard stellar
parameters along with the size and mass of the convective envelope.

axis shows the log-surface-gravity, \logg.
Tracks are colored by the mass of the star.
All models have solar metallicity.
\label{fig:mesa}
}
\end{figure}

We discretize the primary masses generated from the GMMs onto the grid of masses
for which we have \acronym{MESA} models, then use equilibrium tide theory to
compute the change in eccentricity and separation of the companion orbit.
To do this, we solve the coupled differential equations \eqname
s~\ref{eq:dlne}--\ref{eq:dlna} up to the phase of evolution at which the stellar
model has the same (or closest) surface gravity to the simulated primary star.
We assume that all stars are on their first ascent up the giant branch, which
should underestimate the number of circularized systems with surface gravities
$\logg \sim 2.5$ (i.e. near the red clump, where stars have already reached the
tip of the giant branch).
We assume that the equilibrium tides dominate the circularization process for
all systems and therefore ignore the effect of ``dynamical tides''
(\citealt{who}) during the main sequence phase.
Finally, we assume that all of our systems are detached binaries.

\figurename~\ref{fig:simulated} (middle) shows the final periods and
eccentricities of the simulated systems.
As expected, the circularization period for higher \logg\ systems (i.e. smaller
radii, smaller markers) appears to be close to $\sim 10~\textrm{day}$, but the
circularization period for stars with lower \logg\ (i.e. larger radii, larger
markers) is closer to $\sim 100~\textrm{day}$.
In the right panel we normalize the orbital period by \Psurf:
This rescaling removes the dependence on primary size or \logg and predicts that
circularization should occur around $P / \Psurf \approx 10$.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

Our sample of binaries contains primary stars with a range of stellar parameters
(\figurename~\ref{fig:logg-teff-m1}), and therefore a range of expected
circularization periods.
\figurename~\ref{fig:P-e-grid} shows orbital period and eccentricity for all
systems in bins of primary surface gravity.
From top left to bottom right shows bins of decreasing surface gravity, i.e.
from subgiants to giant branch stars.
Vertical dashed lines at $10~\textrm{day}$ and $100~\textrm{day}$ are meant as
reference lines: Note the steadily increasing circularization period from top
left to bottom right as the typical size of the primary increases.

To compare with predictions from the simulated systems
(\sectionname~\ref{sec:theory}) and to remove the dependence on the size of
the primary, \figurename~\ref{fig:PeK} (left) shows normalized period and
eccentricity for all systems.
We compute \Psurf\ (\eqname~\ref{eq:Psurf}) for all systems by assuming that all
primary stars have masses equal to the median mass over all stars with prior
mass measurements in this sample, $M_1 = \med{M_1} = 1.36~\msun$, and all
companions have masses equal to the median over minimum companion masses $M_2 =
\med{M_{2, \textrm{min}}} = 0.5~\msun$.
Based on our simulated population (\sectionname~\ref{sec:theory} and
\figurename~\ref{fig:simulated}), we expect a sharp transition in eccentricity
around $P/\Psurf \approx 10$, and indeed see ...

\section{Discussion} \label{sec:discussion}

- Low-ecc "spur" extends to larger periods. This could be: (a) systems where the companion already evolved (even more efficient), (b) systems that started with smaller ecc. to begin with, (c) red clump stars - circularized at TRGB.

- Outliers? Short-period but eccentric systems?

- Incompleteness at high eccentricity: APOGEE sampling
